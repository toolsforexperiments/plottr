## inspectr: QCoDeS dataset inspection and (live) plotting

You can use the `inspectr` tool to get a simple overview over QCoDeS database
files, and plot datasets contained in the database.

To use: from the root of the cloned plottr repository, run `python apps/inspectr.py [--dbpath <path to your .db file>]`

For basic instructions, check out the Notebook *Live plotting qcodes data* under `/doc/examples`.
