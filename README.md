A framework for inspecting data, based on flowcharts from *pyqtgraph*.
*plottr*'s main aim is to allow the user to define custom data processing flows and plotting.
A particular use case is data filtering and plotting.

## Documentation: 
https://plottr.readthedocs.io (work in progress...)

# Quickstart

## Installation

Plottr is installable from pypi with `pip install plottr`

Plottr requires either the PyQt5 or Pyside2 gui framework.
To install with PyQt5 or Pyside2 backend you can do
``pip install plottr[PyQt5]`` or ``pip install plottr[Pyside2]`` 

Note that if  you have installed ``pyqt`` from ``(Ana)Conda`` you should not use any of these
targets but do ``pip install plottr`` or install Plottr from conda forge:

```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --set channel_priority strict
conda install plottr
```

To install from source: clone the repo, and install using `pip install -e .`

## inspectr: QCoDeS dataset inspection and (live) plotting

You can use the `inspectr` tool to get a simple overview over QCoDeS database
files, and plot datasets contained in the database.

To use: run `plottr-inspectr [--dbpath <path to your .db file>]` 
 
As an alternative from the root of the cloned plottr repository, run `python apps/inspectr.py [--dbpath <path to your .db file>]`

For basic instructions, check out the Notebook *Live plotting qcodes data* under `/doc/examples`.

## Some notes on installing

Note: this package is not compatible with the original `plottr` tool.
You might want to install freshly if you still use the old version.

## Requirements:
* python >= 3.8
* the usual: numpy, mpl, ...
* pandas >= 0.22
* xarray
* pyqtgraph >= 0.12.1
